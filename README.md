The assignment is to create an R project that contains an R program with the following specs:

The user will provide the program with a data sets. The program will calculate and return the test statistics
W used in a Shapiro–Wilk test used to determine if the sample is normally distributed.

The program will have the following features:

* at least two inputs (1 required and 1 default/optional)
  * required input is the data
  * optional/default input (my choice: to perform also the Anderson–Darling test)
* input validation
* at least two very basic/simple tests
* catches errors
  * NA values
  * inf values
  * wrong format
  * wrong dimensions
  
Further more a Rmarkdown file. This file displays the chunk of code of the main R-file, and explains the
two test. The Rmarkdown file will also include the link to the GitHub repository (and if need additional
instructions).
